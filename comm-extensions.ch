Changes for COMMON.W by Andreas Scherer, July 2021.

This set of changes introduces several extensions to the standard behaviour
of the CWEB system.  Several new command line options are provided here, as
well as an extended path search mechanism for lookup of `@i'input files.
See CWEBMAN-EXTENSIONS.CH for details about these new features.
It also incorporates the basis for CTWILL, CWEAVE's evil twin.

This change file requires COMM-PATCH.CH to be applied first.

For a complete history of the changes made to COMMON.W see COMM-PATCH.CH.

Section 36.

@x l.393
@ When an \.{@@i} line is found in the |cur_file|, we must temporarily
stop reading it and start reading from the named include file.  The
\.{@@i} line should give a complete file name with or without
double quotes.
If the environment variable |CWEBINPUTS| is set, or if the compiler flag
of the same name was defined at compile time,
\.{CWEB} will look for include files in the directory thus named, if
it cannot find them in the current directory.
(Colon-separated paths are not supported.)
The remainder of the \.{@@i} line after the file name is ignored.

@ When an \.{@@i} line is found in the |cur_file|, we must temporarily
stop reading it and start reading from the named include file.  The
\.{@@i} line should give a complete file name with or without
double quotes.
The remainder of the \.{@@i} line after the file name is ignored.
\.{CWEB} will look for include files in standard directories specified in the
environment variable |CWEBINPUTS|. Multiple search paths can be specified by
delimiting them with \.{PATH\_SEPARATOR}s.  The given file is searched for in
the current directory first.  You also may include device names; these must
have a \.{DEVICE\_SEPARATOR} as their rightmost character.

Section 68.

@x l.1057
Some implementations may wish to pass the |history| value to the
operating system so that it can be used to govern whether or not other
programs are started. Here, for instance, we pass the operating system
a status of |EXIT_SUCCESS| if and only if only harmless messages were printed.
@^system dependencies@>
@y
On multi-tasking systems like the {\mc AMIGA} it is very convenient to
know a little bit more about the reasons why a program failed.  The four
levels of return indicated by the |history| value are very suitable for
this purpose.  Here, for instance, we pass the operating system a status
of~0 if and only if the run was a complete success.  Any warning or error
message will result in a higher return value, so that {\mc AREXX} scripts
can be made sensitive to these conditions.

Add even more material ...

C and CWEB are `international' languages, so non-English speaking users may
want to write program documentations in their native language instead of in
English.  With the \.{+lX} (or \.{-lX} as well) option CWEAVE includes TeX
macros `Xcwebmac.tex'.  This option works differently than all the others,
because it takes the rest of the command line argument and prepends it to
the string ``cwebmac'' in the first line of the TeX output, so you can call
CWEAVE with the option ``+ldeutsch'' to yield ``\input deutschcwebmac'' in
the first line.

These changes by Andreas Scherer are based on ideas by Carsten Steger
provided in his `CWeb 2.0' port from ><> 551 and his `CWeb 2.8' port
from the electronic nets and on suggestions by Giuseppe Ghib√≤.  The string
argument to the `-l' option was suggested by Carsten Steger in a private
communication in 1994.  Originally this was meant to be the single
character following `l', but there would have been collisions between
``dansk'' and ``deutsch,'' ``espanol'' and ``english,'' and many others.

const char *use_language=""; /* prefix of \.{cwebmac.tex} in \TEX/ output */

@* Path searching.  By default, \.{CTANGLE} and \.{CWEAVE} are looking
for include files along the path |CWEBINPUTS|.  By setting the environment
variable of the same name to a different search path you can suit your
personal needs.  If this variable is empty, some decent defaults are used
internally.  The following procedure takes care that these internal entries
are appended to any setting of the environmnt variable, so you don't have
to repeat the defaults.
