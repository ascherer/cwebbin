\noindent \bit EditorÂ´s Note: \it Although {\itt CTWILL} is based on
{\itt cweave.w}, new and modified material is incorporated all over the place,
without taking special care to keep the original section numbering intact.
\smallskip
\noindent Moreover, this heavily redacted version of {\itt ctwill.pdf} had to
meddle with the section numbering even more, spreading tabular material over
several sections and splitting long sections into smaller chunks in order to
fix overful pages---both horizontally and vertically---, to make the overall
appearance of the {\itt CTWILL} documentation most pleasing to the
readers'~eyes.
\smallskip
\noindent Please do not try to compare this {\itt ctwill.pdf} to the one
created by {\itt CWEAVE} instead of {\itt CTWILL}; the section numbering will
be even more ``off'' from {\itt cweave.w}.  Care has been taken to give a
faithful overall rendering of {\itt CTWILL}'s code, though. \hfill
---Enjoy!\bigskip}

@** Index.
If you have read and understood the code for Phase III above, you know what
is in this index and how it got here. All sections in which an identifier is
used are listed with that identifier, except that reserved words are
indexed only when they appear in format definitions, and the appearances
of identifiers in section names are not indexed. Underlined entries
correspond to where the identifier was declared. Error messages, control
sequences put into the output, and a few
other things like ``recursion'' are indexed here too.
